    <h3 class="title">Description</h3>
    <p class="recipe-text">This is my grandmother's macaroni and cheese recipe that we all crave and only get to have twice a year, if we play our cards right.
     Fairly simple and straightforward. The key is cooking time more than anything.</p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul id="ingredients">
        <li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 pounds Cheddar cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups milk</li>
        <li>5 eggs, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>      
    
    <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>
    <ol id="steps">
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Layer some of the macaroni in a 5-quart baking dish; top with a layer of Cheddar cheese. Continue layering macaroni and Cheddar cheese into the dish, ending with a Cheddar cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Beat milk, eggs, and mustard together in a bowl; pour over macaroni mixture, ensuring milk mixture gets to all of the macaroni.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and just before cheese around the sides gets crisp, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with black pepper before serving.</li>
    </ol>
